"""
Python program that estimates the value of π
using Monte Carlo.

Formula:
Let p = Area of circle = πr² -> Sum of points in circle
Let q = Area of square = (2r)² -> Sum of points in square

p / q = π / 4 = Sum of points in circle / Sum of points in square
π = 4 * (No. of points in circle / No. of points in square)
